# Project Overview
The project aims to develop a system that monitors, detects, and reports suspicious or malicious behavior by employees. This includes unauthorized access to sensitive data, unusual file transfers, and other indicators of insider threats. Given the company's focus on digital art, the system will also need to consider the specific types of files and data relevant to this field.

## Key Components
# 1. Data Collection

System Logs: Collect logs from employee workstations, servers, and network devices.
File Access Monitoring: Track access to sensitive files, especially those related to digital art projects.
Network Traffic: Monitor network traffic for unusual patterns or large data transfers.
Behavior Analysis

Baseline Behavior: Establish a baseline of normal behavior for each employee.
Anomaly Detection: Identify deviations from the baseline using machine learning or rule-based systems.
Alerting and Reporting

Real-time Alerts: Generate alerts for suspicious activities.
Reports: Create detailed reports for further investigation.
User Interface

Dashboard: Provide a dashboard for security personnel to monitor alerts and access reports.
## Technologies and Tools
# 1. Python for scripting and implementing machine learning models.
# 2. Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana (ELK Stack) for log management and visualization.
# 3. Scikit-learn or TensorFlow for anomaly detection models.
# 4. Flask or Django for developing the user interface.
